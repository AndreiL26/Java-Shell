What did I do last time?
- I created a Command Manager that holds only one instance of every command class and handles the logic of executing the correct command
- Added a Utilites package that contains several classes which provide utility methods for the commands and for the Jsh class

What do I plan to do now?
- Add more of the required commands 
- Continue testing the existing commands using the new test model

Am I blocked on anything?
 - No
