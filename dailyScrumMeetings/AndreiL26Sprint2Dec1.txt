What did I do last time?
- Created a model for adding tests that are independent of the machine that runs it
- Gained access to the Reference Design by solving the Delta Debuggin Exercise

What do I plan to do now?
- Refactor the command classes to reflect to our new design that is influenced by the reference design
- Add a number of Utility classes that prove to be necessary at the moment

Am I blocked on anything?
 - No
