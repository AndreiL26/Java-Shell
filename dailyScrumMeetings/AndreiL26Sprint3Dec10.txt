What did I do last time?
- Changed the implementation of sed, grep, cat, tail and head to allow reading from standard input
- Added tests for the above mentioned classes to cover reading from standard input

What do I plan to do now?
- Once again refactor the classes to allow for the implementation of Piping

Am I blocked on anything?
 - No
