What did I do last time?
- Tried to modify the commands and the 'dummy' parser to allow for IO redirection

What do I plan to do now?
- Integrate the new parser with the existing code
- Refactor commands for IO redirection

Am I blocked on anything?
- Yes, on how to modify commands for IO redirection
